# Write the classes and methods that will be necessary to make this code run, and print the following output:

# P Hanson has adopted the following pets:
# a cat named Butterscotch
# a cat named Pudding
# a bearded dragon named Darwin

# B Holmes has adopted the following pets:
# a dog named Molly
# a parakeet named Sweetie Pie
# a dog named Kennedy
# a fish named Chester

# P Hanson has 3 adopted pets.
# B Holmes has 4 adopted pets.

# The order of the output does not matter, so long as all of the information is presented. Add your own name and pets to this project.
# Suppose the shelter has a number of not-yet-adopted pets, and wants to manage them through this same system.
# Thus, you should be able to add the following output to the example output shown above:

# The Animal Shelter has the following unadopted pets:
# a dog named Asta
# a dog named Laddie
# a cat named Fluffy
# a cat named Kat
# a cat named Ben
# a parakeet named Chatterbox
# a parakeet named Bluebell

# P Hanson has 3 adopted pets.
# B Holmes has 4 adopted pets.
# The Animal shelter has 7 unadopted pets.

# Can you make these updates to your solution? Did you need to change your class system at all? Were you able to make all of your changes without modifying the existing interface?
