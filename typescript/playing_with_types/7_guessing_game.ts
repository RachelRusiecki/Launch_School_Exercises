// Declare a variable userID without a type annotation and assign an initial number. Then, think about what would happen if you try to assign a string to the same variable on the next line. Test your hypothesis by actually doing it and observe the result.

// Expected outcome:

// An error indicating a type mismatch.

let userID = 1;
userID = '1'; // Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.
